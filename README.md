<h1>About Buddhist Solar Time App</h1>

<img href="/images/main-logo.png">
<p>The sixth precept in Buddhism advises practitioners to refrain from eating at improper times, traditionally meaning after solar noon‚Äîthe time when the sun is at its highest point. During the Buddha‚Äôs time, this was observed according to the actual position of the sun in the sky, not by a standardized clock. However, modern timekeeping, which relies on fixed national or regional time zones, does not account for the Earth's curvature or longitudinal differences. As a result, solar noon can vary significantly even within the same country.</p>

<p>This app helps practitioners respect the original intent of the precept by accurately determining solar noon based on their precise location, allowing for a more faithful and mindful observance of this ethical guideline.</p>
