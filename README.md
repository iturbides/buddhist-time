<h1>About Buddhist Sundial App</h1>
<h2>Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammƒÅ-sambuddhassa</h2>

<p>The sixth precept in Buddhism advises practitioners to refrain from eating at improper times, traditionally meaning after solar noon‚Äîthe time when the sun is at its highest point. During the Buddha‚Äôs time, solar noon was observed not by standardized clocks but through the shadow of the sun, often using simple instruments like gnomons‚Äîvertical rods or markers that indicate the sun's position by the length and angle of their shadow. This natural method allowed for a direct connection with the sun‚Äôs movement in the sky.</p>

<p>However, modern timekeeping, which relies on fixed national or regional time zones, does not account for the Earth's curvature or longitudinal differences. As a result, solar noon can vary significantly even within the same country.</p>

<p>This app helps practitioners respect the original intent of the precept by accurately determining solar noon based on their precise location, allowing for a more faithful and mindful observance of this ethical guideline.</p>


## üß†‚è≥ Biological Clocks, Circadian Rhythms, and the Role of the Sun

All living organisms‚Äîfrom plants and animals to humans‚Äîpossess internal biological clocks that regulate essential functions like sleep, metabolism, hormone production, digestion, body temperature, and cognitive performance. These internal systems follow what scientists call the **circadian rhythm**, a roughly 24-hour cycle that is deeply influenced by one central cue: **the sun**.

In nature, biological clocks align closely with the **solar cycle**. The rising and setting of the sun provide light signals that synchronize our internal clocks with the external world‚Äîa process known as **entrainment**. In humans, the master clock resides in the **suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)** of the brain, which receives direct input from light-sensitive cells in the eyes. This master clock, in turn, helps coordinate peripheral clocks in other tissues and organs throughout the body.

However, due to **modern lifestyles shaped by social, political, and economic demands**, most people now follow what researchers call **"social time"**‚Äîfixed schedules dictated by time zones, work hours, and artificial lighting, rather than the natural movement of the sun. This disconnect between **biological time** and **social time** is referred to as **social jet lag**, a chronic state of circadian misalignment. A growing body of research links this misalignment to a variety of health problems.


Understanding and respecting solar time can be an important step toward realigning our lives with natural rhythms.

Unlike standard clocks or mobile devices that display civil time based on arbitrary time zones, this app calculates the actual **solar time** at your specific location, helping you reconnect with nature‚Äôs original clock.


By showing you when **true solar noon** occurs‚Äîwhen the sun is at its highest point in the sky‚Äî**Buddhist Sundial**  can serve as a practical tool for:

- Understanding how your biological clock may be out of sync with your daily schedule  
- Making more mindful decisions about meal times, sleep, and light exposure  
- Supporting spiritual or ethical practices that depend on natural timing, such as the sixth Buddhist precept
